Detailed Description
--------------------



    The :class:`PySide.QtGui.QFileOpenEvent` class provides an event that will be sent when there is a request to open a file or a URL.

    File open events will be sent to the :meth:`QApplication.instance()<PySide.QtGui.QApplication.instance>` when the operating system requests that a file or URL should be opened. This is a high-level event that can be caused by different user actions depending on the user's desktop environment; for example, double clicking on an file icon in the Finder on Mac OS X.

    This event is only used to notify the application of a request. It may be safely ignored.

    .. note::  This class is currently supported for Mac OS X only.
