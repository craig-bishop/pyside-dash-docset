Detailed Description
--------------------



    The :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` class provides platform-independent threads.

    A :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` represents a separate thread of control within the program; it shares data with all the other threads within the process but executes independently in the way that a separate program does on a multitasking operating system. Instead of starting in ``main()`` , QThreads begin executing in :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` . By default, :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` starts the event loop by calling :meth:`~PySide.QtCore.QThread.exec` (see below). To create your own threads, subclass :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` and reimplement :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` . For example:

    ::

        class MyThread (QThread):
            def run():
                socket = QTcpSocket()
                # connect QTcpSocket's signals somewhere meaningful
                # ...
                socket.connectToHost(hostName, portNumber)
                self.exec_()


    This will create a :class:`PySide.QtNetwork.QTcpSocket` in the thread and then execute the thread's event loop. Use the :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` method to begin execution. Execution ends when you return from :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` , just as an application does when it leaves main(). :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` will notifiy you via a signal when the thread is :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.started` , :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.finished` , and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminated` , or you can use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.isFinished` and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.isRunning` to query the state of the thread. Use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.wait` to block until the thread has finished execution.

    Each thread gets its own stack from the operating system. The operating system also determines the default size of the stack. You can use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setStackSize` to set a custom stack size.

    Each :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` can have its own event loop. You can start the event loop by calling :meth:`~PySide.QtCore.QThread.exec` ; you can stop it by calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit` or :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.quit` . Having an event loop in a thread makes it possible to connect signals from other threads to slots in this thread, using a mechanism called :attr:`queued connections<Qt.ConnectionType>` . It also makes it possible to use classes that require the event loop, such as :class:`PySide.QtCore.QTimer` and :class:`PySide.QtNetwork.QTcpSocket` , in the thread. Note, however, that it is not possible to use any widget classes in the thread.

    In extreme cases, you may want to forcibly :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` an executing thread. However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged. Please read the documentation for :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setTerminationEnabled` for detailed information.

    The static functions :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.currentThreadId` and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.currentThread` return identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former returns a platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns a :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` pointer.

    :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` also provides platform independent sleep functions in varying resolutions. Use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.sleep` for full second resolution, :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.msleep` for millisecond resolution, and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.usleep` for microsecond resolution.

.. class:: QThread([parent=None])

    :param parent: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QObject`

    Constructs a new thread with the given ``parent`` . The thread does not begin executing until :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` is called.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` 

.. attribute:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.Priority

    This enum type indicates how the operating system should schedule newly created threads.

.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.cleanup()








.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.currentThread()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread`




    Returns a pointer to a :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` which represents the currently executing thread.



.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.currentThreadId()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.Qt::HANDLE`




    Returns the thread handle of the currently executing thread.

    .. warning::  The handle returned by this function is used for internal purposes and should not be used in any application code.

    .. warning::  On Windows, the returned value is a pseudo-handle for the current thread. It can't be used for numerical comparison. i.e., this function returns the DWORD (Windows-Thread ID) returned by the Win32 function getCurrentThreadId(), not the HANDLE (Windows-Thread HANDLE) returned by the Win32 function getCurrentThread().



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.exec_()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Enters the event loop and waits until :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit` is called, returning the value that was passed to :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit` . The value returned is 0 if :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit` is called via :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.quit` .

    It is necessary to call this function to start event handling.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.quit`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit([retcode=0])


    :param retcode: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Tells the thread's event loop to exit with a return code.

    After calling this function, the thread leaves the event loop and returns from the call to :meth:`QEventLoop.exec()<PySide.QtCore.QEventLoop.exec>` . The :meth:`QEventLoop.exec()<PySide.QtCore.QEventLoop.exec>` function returns ``returnCode`` .

    By convention, a ``returnCode`` of 0 means success, any non-zero value indicates an error.

    Note that unlike the C library function of the same name, this function *does* return to the caller -- it is event processing that stops.

    This function does nothing if the thread does not have an event loop.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.quit`  :class:`PySide.QtCore.QEventLoop` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.finished()








.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.idealThreadCount()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Returns the ideal number of threads that can be run on the system. This is done querying the number of processor cores, both real and logical, in the system. This function returns -1 if the number of processor cores could not be detected.



.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.initialize()








.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.isFinished()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    Returns true if the thread is finished; otherwise returns false.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.isRunning` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.isRunning()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    Returns true if the thread is running; otherwise returns false.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.isFinished` 


.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.msleep(arg__1)


    :param arg__1: long




    Causes the current thread to sleep for ``msecs`` milliseconds.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.sleep`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.usleep` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.priority()


    :rtype: :attr:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.Priority`




    Returns the priority for a running thread. If the thread is not running, this function returns ``InheritPriority`` .

    .. seealso::  :attr:`QThread.Priority`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setPriority`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.quit()






    Tells the thread's event loop to exit with return code 0 (success). Equivalent to calling QThread::exit(0).

    This function does nothing if the thread does not have an event loop.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.exit`  :class:`PySide.QtCore.QEventLoop` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.run()






    The starting point for the thread. After calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` , the newly created thread calls this function. The default implementation simply calls :meth:`~PySide.QtCore.QThread.exec` .

    You can reimplemented this function to do other useful work. Returning from this method will end the execution of the thread.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.wait` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.setPriority(priority)


    :param priority: :attr:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.Priority`




    This function sets the ``priority`` for a running thread. If the thread is not running, this function does nothing and returns immediately. Use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` to start a thread with a specific priority.

    The ``priority`` argument can be any value in the ``QThread::Priority`` enum except for ``InheritPriorty`` .

    The effect of the ``priority`` parameter is dependent on the operating system's scheduling policy. In particular, the ``priority`` will be ignored on systems that do not support thread priorities (such as on Linux, see http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched\_setscheduler for more details).

    .. seealso::  :attr:`QThread.Priority`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.priority`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.start` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.setStackSize(stackSize)


    :param stackSize: :class:`PySide.QtCore.uint`




    Sets the maximum stack size for the thread to ``stackSize`` . If ``stackSize`` is greater than zero, the maximum stack size is set to ``stackSize`` bytes, otherwise the maximum stack size is automatically determined by the operating system.

    .. warning::  Most operating systems place minimum and maximum limits on thread stack sizes. The thread will fail to start if the stack size is outside these limits.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.stackSize` 


.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.setTerminationEnabled([enabled=true])


    :param enabled: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    Enables or disables termination of the current thread based on the ``enabled`` parameter. The thread must have been started by :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` .

    When ``enabled`` is false, termination is disabled. Future calls to :meth:`QThread.terminate()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate>` will return immediately without effect. Instead, the termination is deferred until termination is enabled.

    When ``enabled`` is true, termination is enabled. Future calls to :meth:`QThread.terminate()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate>` will terminate the thread normally. If termination has been deferred (i.e. :meth:`QThread.terminate()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate>` was called with termination disabled), this function will terminate the calling thread *immediately* . Note that this function will not return in this case.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` 


.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.sleep(arg__1)


    :param arg__1: long




    Forces the current thread to sleep for ``secs`` seconds.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.msleep`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.usleep` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.stackSize()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.uint`




    Returns the maximum stack size for the thread (if set with :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setStackSize` ); otherwise returns zero.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setStackSize` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.start([priority=InheritPriority])


    :param priority: :attr:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.Priority`




    Begins execution of the thread by calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` , which should be reimplemented in a :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` subclass to contain your code. The operating system will schedule the thread according to the ``priority`` parameter. If the thread is already running, this function does nothing.

    The effect of the ``priority`` parameter is dependent on the operating system's scheduling policy. In particular, the ``priority`` will be ignored on systems that do not support thread priorities (such as on Linux, see http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched\_setscheduler for more details).

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.started()








.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate()






    Terminates the execution of the thread. The thread may or may not be terminated immediately, depending on the operating systems scheduling policies. Use :meth:`QThread.wait()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.wait>` after :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` for synchronous termination.

    When the thread is terminated, all threads waiting for the thread to finish will be woken up.

    .. warning::  This function is dangerous and its use is discouraged. The thread can be terminated at any point in its code path. Threads can be terminated while modifying data. There is no chance for the thread to clean up after itself, unlock any held mutexes, etc. In short, use this function only if absolutely necessary.

    Termination can be explicitly enabled or disabled by calling :meth:`QThread.setTerminationEnabled()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.setTerminationEnabled>` . Calling this function while termination is disabled results in the termination being deferred, until termination is re-enabled. See the documentation of :meth:`QThread.setTerminationEnabled()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.setTerminationEnabled>` for more information.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.setTerminationEnabled` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminated()








.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.usleep(arg__1)


    :param arg__1: long




    Causes the current thread to sleep for ``usecs`` microseconds.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.sleep`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.msleep` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.wait([time=4294967295UL])


    :param time: long
    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    Blocks the thread until either of these conditions is met:


    * The thread associated with this :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` object has finished execution (i.e. when it returns from :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` ). This function will return true if the thread has finished. It also returns true if the thread has not been started yet.
    * ``time`` milliseconds has elapsed. If ``time`` is ULONG\_MAX (the default), then the wait will never timeout (the thread must return from :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.run` ). This function will return false if the wait timed out.

    This provides similar functionality to the POSIX ``pthread_join()`` function.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.sleep`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThread.terminate` 


.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThread.yieldCurrentThread()






    Yields execution of the current thread to another runnable thread, if any. Note that the operating system decides to which thread to switch.
