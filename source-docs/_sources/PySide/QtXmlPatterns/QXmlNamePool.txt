Detailed Description
--------------------



    The :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlNamePool` class is a table of shared strings referenced by instances of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` .

    :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlNamePool` is used to optimize operations on instances of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` . An instance of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` represents an XML name in a way that allows the XML name to be compared and passed around efficiently. The efficiency is achieved by storing the strings comprising the XML names in an instance of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlNamePool` , where they are mapped to binary identifiers, which are then packed into a key which is stored in the :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` .

    This means that each instance of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` is tied to the name pool it was created with, and that name pool should be kept in scope and used to create all instances of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` that might be compared. Note also that the name pool is required if you must reconstitute the :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` as text, or if you must access any of its component strings, so although instances of :class:`PySide.QtXmlPatterns.QXmlName` can be compared without reference to a name pool, the name pool must be kept in scope if the name's strings must be accessed later.
